inventory
-10,000ms to read iventory from disk
-10ms to process each transaction
n transactions takes (10,000 + 10n)ms,  10n is more important if n is large.


Big-oh Notation (upper bounds)
Let n be size of program's input.
Let t(n) be function e.g. running time
Let f(n) be another function - preferably simple
T(n) < O(f(n)) if & Only if T(n) <= C f(n); whenever n is big for some large constant C.
how big is Big? Big enough to make T(n) fit under C f(n)
How large is Large? enough to make T(n) fit under C f(n)

example : inventory function
T(n) = 10,000 + 10n
let's try f(n) = n
if constant C is 20, when n >= 1000, Cf(n) >= T(n).
For any n >= 1000, T(n) <= C f(n). therefore, T(n) < O(f(n)).

Formally : O(f(n)) is the set of all functions T9n) that satisfy
there exist positive constants C and N such that, for all n >= N, T(n) <= C f(n).



Examples:
1. 1,000,000n < O(n) - Proof Choose C = 1,000,000.
	1. Big oh notation doesn't care about (most) constant factors.
2. n < O(n^3) Proof set c =1, N =1
3. n^3 + n^2 + n < O(n^3) proof set c = 3, N = 1
	1. Big oh notation is usually used to indicate dominating (fastest-growing) term.


Table of Important Big Oh Sets
Smallest to Largest
		Function     |     common name
smallest	O(1)                    constant
		O(log n)              logorithmic
		O(log^2 n)          log-squared
		O(root n)             root-n
		O(n)                     linear
		O(nlog n)
		O(n^2)                 quadratic
		O(n^3)                 cubic
		O(n^4)                 quartic
		O(2^n)                 exponential
largest		O(e^n)                 exponential(but more so)


O(nlogn) or faster time considered efficient
n^7 ro slower time considered useless.

## Warnings
1. fallacious proof : C = n then n^2 <= n^2     -> WRONG C must be a constant!!
2. Big oh notation Does Not say 'What the functions are'
	1. Binary search on an array
		1. worst case running time < O(log n)
		2. best case running time < O(1)
		3. Memory use < O(n)
		4. 47+18log n - 3/n < O(the worst case running time)
3. e^3n < O(e^n) because constant factors don't matter(관련이 없다. 중요하지 않다.) -> WRONG!!
	1. e^3n is bigger by a factor of e^2n 
	2. 10^n < O(2^n) -> 10^n is bigger by a factor of 5^n 
4. Big oh notation doesn't always tell whole strory
	1. T(n) = n log n
	2. U(n) = 100 n
	3. T(n) dominates U(n) asymptotically. log_2 n < 50 in preactice.
